# pom_autotest_project_booking
This project was created for automated testing of the booking.com website using the Page Object pattern in Python.
To run autotests:
1. Copy the repository via SSH.
2. Create a virtual environment.
3. Download all modules to the virtual environment (from requirements.txt)
4. Tests are run from my business card website (which can be run from the local host through the app.py module) or through a bash script from the scripts directory.
5. Viewing the report on passing tests also occurs through a business card site or through a bash script from the scripts directory.
